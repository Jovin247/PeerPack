## What Problem are we solving

- In our current situation, if a person wants to send a courier or a parcel to a friend or relative abroad, they search for another friend or relative who are 
  travelling there and give that parcel to them. 
- Every time such a person may not be available. Thatâ€™s where we come in. We convert each passenger into a courier service. They just want to upload their courier 
  details onto our app and search for a carrier to accept that. 

## Benefits

- Low cost last minute delivery.
- A person who wants to send a parcel very urgent to a person in another country, our app is very useful. They just upload it to our app, wait for a carrier and 
  pass it onto them.
- The flight time is the time taken to deliver the parcel.
